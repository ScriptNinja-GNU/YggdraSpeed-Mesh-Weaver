## 🔧 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Root access to your system 🔑
- Basic knowledge of networking concepts (helpful but not required) 📚

## 🌍 Before You Begin: A Note on Ports

Hey there, network navigator! 👋 Before you dive into the installation, let's talk ports for a sec.

- 🇮🇷🌏 Got a server in Iran and another abroad? Awesome! In this case, stick with the default port (9101). It's like the classic "meet me at the usual spot" for your servers.
- 🌐🔢 have a different setup or many servers? No worries! You'll get to pick your own port during the setup. It's like choosing your own secret handshake for your network.

Remember, choosing the right port is crucial for smooth sailing in the Yggdrasil seas. Choose wisely, captain! ⚓🚢
